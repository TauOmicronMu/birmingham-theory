<h1>Theoretical Computer Science at Birmingham</h1>

<p>We are one of the largest research groups in the world with a focus on the logical foundations of computer science. Much of our work makes use of techniques such as category theory, type theory, topology, domain theory, and game semantics. We apply these tools to deep and conceptual questions in a broad range of areas, including programming languages, automated theorem proving, combinatorics, formal verification, and quantum computation, as well as the foundations of mathematics.</p>
