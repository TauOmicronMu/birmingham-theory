<h1 class="theory">Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Birmingham</h1>

<p>We are one of the largest research groups in the world with a focus on the logical foundations of computer science. Much of our work makes use of techniques such as category theory, type theory, topology, and game semantics, which we apply to deep and conceptual questions in a broad range of areas, including programming languages, automated theorem proving, combinatorics, formal verification, and quantum computation, as well as the foundations of mathematics.</p>
